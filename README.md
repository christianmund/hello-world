# hello-world
my first repository

Hello all! My name is Christian. Just dropping in to say hi and let you know a couple things about myself. First of all, I'm here to learn how to code. Hopefully this is the first step on a fulfilling path. Other than that, I absolutely love music, and the goal is to someday cobine these two interests!
